protein or dna for a specific pattern specified in either
prosite or IUPAC format respectively.  They take in a few command
line arguments as follows:

./hw1.exe [sequence file] [search file] [output file]

[sequence file]: The file containing the FASTA formatted sequence to be analyzed 
[search file]: The file containing either the IUPAC or Prosite format search pattern
[output file]: The file to which to save the results
