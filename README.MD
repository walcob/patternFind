# PatternFind

This project was submitted for Bioinformatics I HW 1 at RPI in Fall 2012.

This program is intended to search a FASTA sequence of a  protein or dna for a specific pattern specified in either prosite or IUPAC format respectively.  It takes in a few command line arguments as follows:

```
./hw1.exe [sequence file] [search file] [output file]
```

*sequence file*: The file containing the FASTA formatted sequence to be analyzed 
*search file*: The file containing either the IUPAC or Prosite format search pattern
*output file*: The file to which to save the results
